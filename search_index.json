Your Projects.\nGYP is a Meta-Build system: a build system that generates other build systems.\nSource code: https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/gyp\nMailing list:  http://groups.google.com/group/gyp-developer\nGYP is intended to support large projects that need to be built on multiple\nplatforms (e.g., Mac, Windows, Linux), and where it is important that\nthe project can be built using the IDEs that are popular on each platform\nas if the project is a &quot;native&quot; one.\nIt can be used to generate XCode projects, Visual Studio projects, Ninja\nbuild files, and Makefiles. In each case GYP&#39;s goal is to replicate as\nclosely as possible the way one would set up a native build of the project\nusing the IDE.\nGYP can also be used to generate &quot;hybrid&quot; projects that provide the IDE\nscaffolding for a nice user experience but call out to Ninja to do the actual\nbuilding (which is usually much faster than the native build systems of the\nIDEs).\nFor more information on GYP, click on the links above.\nFrom\nSource from https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/gyp/+/md-pages\n"},"docs/UserDocumentation.html":{"url":"docs/UserDocumentation.html","title":"User documentation","body":"User Documentation\n[TOC]\nIntroduction\nThis document is intended to provide a user-level guide to GYP.  The\nemphasis here is on how to use GYP to accomplish specific tasks, not on\nthe complete technical language specification.  (For that, see the\nLanguageSpecification.)\nThe document below starts with some overviews to provide context: an\noverview of the structure of a .gyp file itself, an overview of a\ntypical executable-program target in a .gyp file, an an overview of a\ntypical library target in a .gyp file.\nAfter the overviews, there are examples of gyp patterns for different\ncommon use cases.\nSkeleton of a typical Chromium .gyp file\nHere is the skeleton of a typical .gyp file in the Chromium tree:\n  {\n    &#39;variables&#39;: {\n      .\n      .\n      .\n    },\n    &#39;includes&#39;: [\n      &#39;../build/common.gypi&#39;,\n    ],\n    &#39;target_defaults&#39;: {\n      .\n      .\n      .\n    },\n    &#39;targets&#39;: [\n      {\n        &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;target_1&#39;,\n          .\n          .\n          .\n      },\n      {\n        &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;target_2&#39;,\n          .\n          .\n          .\n      },\n    ],\n    &#39;conditions&#39;: [\n      [&#39;OS==&quot;linux&quot;&#39;, {\n        &#39;targets&#39;: [\n          {\n            &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;linux_target_3&#39;,\n              .\n              .\n              .\n          },\n        ],\n      }],\n      [&#39;OS==&quot;win&quot;&#39;, {\n        &#39;targets&#39;: [\n          {\n            &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;windows_target_4&#39;,\n              .\n              .\n              .\n          },\n        ],\n      }, { # OS != &quot;win&quot;\n        &#39;targets&#39;: [\n          {\n            &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;non_windows_target_5&#39;,\n              .\n              .\n              .\n          },\n      }],\n    ],\n  }\n\nThe entire file just contains a Python dictionary.  (It&#39;s actually JSON,\nwith two small Pythonic deviations: comments are introduced with #,\nand a , (comma)) is legal after the last element in a list or\ndictionary.)\nThe top-level pieces in the .gyp file are as follows:\n&#39;variables&#39;:  Definitions of variables that can be interpolated and\nused in various other parts of the file.\n&#39;includes&#39;:  A list of of other files that will be included in this\nfile.  By convention, included files have the suffix .gypi (gyp\ninclude).\n&#39;target_defaults&#39;:  Settings that will apply to all of the targets\ndefined in this .gyp file.\n&#39;targets&#39;:  The list of targets for which this .gyp file can\ngenerate builds.  Each target is a dictionary that contains settings\ndescribing all the information necessary to build the target.\n&#39;conditions&#39;:  A list of condition specifications that can modify the\ncontents of the items in the global dictionary defined by this .gyp\nfile based on the values of different variablwes.  As implied by the\nabove example, the most common use of a conditions section in the\ntop-level dictionary is to add platform-specific targets to the\ntargets list.\nSkeleton of a typical executable target in a .gyp file\nThe most straightforward target is probably a simple executable program.\nHere is an example executable target that demonstrates the features\nthat should cover most simple uses of gyp:\n  {\n    &#39;targets&#39;: [\n      {\n        &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;foo&#39;,\n        &#39;type&#39;: &#39;executable&#39;,\n        &#39;msvs_guid&#39;: &#39;5ECEC9E5-8F23-47B6-93E0-C3B328B3BE65&#39;,\n        &#39;dependencies&#39;: [\n          &#39;xyzzy&#39;,\n          &#39;../bar/bar.gyp:bar&#39;,\n        ],\n        &#39;defines&#39;: [\n          &#39;DEFINE_FOO&#39;,\n          &#39;DEFINE_A_VALUE=value&#39;,\n        ],\n        &#39;include_dirs&#39;: [\n          &#39;..&#39;,\n        ],\n        &#39;sources&#39;: [\n          &#39;file1.cc&#39;,\n          &#39;file2.cc&#39;,\n        ],\n        &#39;conditions&#39;: [\n          [&#39;OS==&quot;linux&quot;&#39;, {\n            &#39;defines&#39;: [\n              &#39;LINUX_DEFINE&#39;,\n            ],\n            &#39;include_dirs&#39;: [\n              &#39;include/linux&#39;,\n            ],\n          }],\n          [&#39;OS==&quot;win&quot;&#39;, {\n            &#39;defines&#39;: [\n              &#39;WINDOWS_SPECIFIC_DEFINE&#39;,\n            ],\n          }, { # OS != &quot;win&quot;,\n            &#39;defines&#39;: [\n              &#39;NON_WINDOWS_DEFINE&#39;,\n            ],\n          }]\n        ],\n      },\n    ],\n  }\nThe top-level settings in the target include:\n&#39;target_name&#39;: The name by which the target should be known, which\nshould be unique across all .gyp files.  This name will be used as the\nproject name in the generated Visual Studio solution, as the target name\nin the generated XCode configuration, and as the alias for building this\ntarget from the command line of the generated SCons configuration.\n&#39;type&#39;: Set to executable, logically enough.\n&#39;msvs_guid&#39;: THIS IS ONLY TRANSITIONAL.  This is a hard-coded GUID\nvalues that will be used in the generated Visual Studio solution\nfile(s).  This allows us to check in a chrome.sln file that\ninteroperates with gyp-generated project files.  Once everything in\nChromium is being generated by gyp, it will no longer be important that\nthe GUIDs stay constant across invocations, and we&#39;ll likely get rid of\nthese settings,\n&#39;dependencies&#39;: This lists other targets that this target depends on.\nThe gyp-generated files will guarantee that the other targets are built\nbefore this target.  Any library targets in the dependencies list will\nbe linked with this target.  The various settings (defines,\ninclude_dirs, etc.) listed in the direct_dependent_settings sections\nof the targets in this list will be applied to how this target is\nbuilt and linked.  See the more complete discussion of\ndirect_dependent_settings, below.\n&#39;defines&#39;: The C preprocessor definitions that will be passed in on\ncompilation command lines (using -D or /D options).\n&#39;include_dirs&#39;: The directories in which included header files live.\nThese will be passed in on compilation command lines (using -I or /I\noptions).\n&#39;sources&#39;: The source files for this target.\n&#39;conditions&#39;: A block of conditions that will be evaluated to update\nthe different settings in the target dictionary.\nSkeleton of a typical library target in a .gyp file\nThe vast majority of targets are libraries.  Here is an example of a\nlibrary target including the additional features that should cover most\nneeds of libraries:\n  {\n    &#39;targets&#39;: [\n      {\n        &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;foo&#39;,\n        &#39;type&#39;: &#39;&lt;(library)&#39;\n        &#39;msvs_guid&#39;: &#39;5ECEC9E5-8F23-47B6-93E0-C3B328B3BE65&#39;,\n        &#39;dependencies&#39;: [\n          &#39;xyzzy&#39;,\n          &#39;../bar/bar.gyp:bar&#39;,\n        ],\n        &#39;defines&#39;: [\n          &#39;DEFINE_FOO&#39;,\n          &#39;DEFINE_A_VALUE=value&#39;,\n        ],\n        &#39;include_dirs&#39;: [\n          &#39;..&#39;,\n        ],\n        &#39;direct_dependent_settings&#39;: {\n          &#39;defines&#39;: [\n            &#39;DEFINE_FOO&#39;,\n            &#39;DEFINE_ADDITIONAL&#39;,\n          ],\n          &#39;linkflags&#39;: [\n          ],\n        },\n        &#39;export_dependent_settings&#39;: [\n          &#39;../bar/bar.gyp:bar&#39;,\n        ],\n        &#39;sources&#39;: [\n          &#39;file1.cc&#39;,\n          &#39;file2.cc&#39;,\n        ],\n        &#39;conditions&#39;: [\n          [&#39;OS==&quot;linux&quot;&#39;, {\n            &#39;defines&#39;: [\n              &#39;LINUX_DEFINE&#39;,\n            ],\n            &#39;include_dirs&#39;: [\n              &#39;include/linux&#39;,\n            ],\n          ],\n          [&#39;OS==&quot;win&quot;&#39;, {\n            &#39;defines&#39;: [\n              &#39;WINDOWS_SPECIFIC_DEFINE&#39;,\n            ],\n          }, { # OS != &quot;win&quot;,\n            &#39;defines&#39;: [\n              &#39;NON_WINDOWS_DEFINE&#39;,\n            ],\n          }]\n        ],\n    ],\n  }\nThe possible entries in a library target are largely the same as those\nthat can be specified for an executable target (defines,\ninclude_dirs, etc.).  The differences include:\n&#39;type&#39;: This should almost always be set to &#39;&lt;(library)&#39;, which allows\nthe user to define at gyp time whether libraries are to be built static\nor shared.  (On Linux, at least, linking with shared libraries saves\nsignificant link time.) If it&#39;s necessary to pin down the type of\nlibrary to be built, the type can be set explicitly to\nstatic_library or shared_library.\n&#39;direct_dependent_settings&#39;: This defines the settings that will be\napplied to other targets that directly depend on this target--that is,\nthat list this target in their &#39;dependencies&#39; setting.  This is\nwhere you list the defines, include_dirs, cflags and linkflags\nthat other targets that compile or link against this target need to\nbuild consistently.\n&#39;export_dependent_settings&#39;: This lists the targets whose\ndirect_dependent_settings should be &quot;passed on&quot; to other targets that\nuse (depend on) this target.  TODO:  expand on this description.\nUse Cases\nThese use cases are intended to cover the most common actions performed\nby developers using GYP.\nNote that these examples are not fully-functioning, self-contained\nexamples (or else they&#39;d be way too long).  Each example mostly contains\njust the keywords and settings relevant to the example, with perhaps a\nfew extra keywords for context.  The intent is to try to show the\nspecific pieces you need to pay attention to when doing something.\n[NOTE:  if practical use shows that these examples are confusing without\nadditional context, please add what&#39;s necessary to clarify things.]\nAdd new source files\nThere are similar but slightly different patterns for adding a\nplatform-independent source file vs. adding a source file that only\nbuilds on some of the supported platforms.\nAdd a source file that builds on all platforms\nSimplest possible case: You are adding a file(s) that builds on all\nplatforms.\nJust add the file(s) to the sources list of the appropriate dictionary\nin the targets list:\n  {\n    &#39;targets&#39;: [\n      {\n        &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;my_target&#39;,\n        &#39;type&#39;: &#39;executable&#39;,\n        &#39;sources&#39;: [\n          &#39;../other/file_1.cc&#39;,\n          &#39;new_file.cc&#39;,\n          &#39;subdir/file3.cc&#39;,\n        ],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\nFile path names are relative to the directory in which the .gyp file lives.\nKeep the list sorted alphabetically (unless there&#39;s a really, really,\nreally good reason not to).\nAdd a platform-specific source file\nYour platform-specific file is named *_linux.{ext}, *_mac.{ext}, *_posix.{ext} or *_win.{ext}\nThe simplest way to add a platform-specific source file, assuming you&#39;re\nadding a completely new file and get to name it, is to use one of the\nfollowing standard suffixes:\n\n_linux  (e.g. foo_linux.cc)\n_mac    (e.g. foo_mac.cc)\n_posix  (e.g. foo_posix.cc)\n_win    (e.g. foo_win.cc)\n\nSimply add the file to the sources list of the appropriate dict within\nthe targets list, like you would any other source file.\n  {\n    &#39;targets&#39;: [\n      {\n        &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;foo&#39;,\n        &#39;type&#39;: &#39;executable&#39;,\n        &#39;sources&#39;: [\n          &#39;independent.cc&#39;,\n          &#39;specific_win.cc&#39;,\n        ],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\nThe Chromium .gyp files all have appropriate conditions entries to\nfilter out the files that aren&#39;t appropriate for the current platform.\nIn the above example, the specific_win.cc file will be removed\nautomatically from the source-list on non-Windows builds.\nYour platform-specific file does not use an already-defined pattern\nIf your platform-specific file does not contain a\n*_{linux,mac,posix,win} substring (or some other pattern that&#39;s\nalready in the conditions for the target), and you can&#39;t change the\nfile name, there are two patterns that can be used.\nPrefererred:  Add the file to the sources list of the appropriate\ndictionary within the targets list.  Add an appropriate conditions\nsection to exclude the specific files name:\n  {\n    &#39;targets&#39;: [\n      {\n        &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;foo&#39;,\n        &#39;type&#39;: &#39;executable&#39;,\n        &#39;sources&#39;: [\n          &#39;linux_specific.cc&#39;,\n        ],\n        &#39;conditions&#39;: [\n          [&#39;OS != &quot;linux&quot;&#39;, {\n            &#39;sources!&#39;: [\n              # Linux-only; exclude on other platforms.\n              &#39;linux_specific.cc&#39;,\n            ]\n          }[,\n        ],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\nDespite the duplicate listing, the above is generally preferred because\nthe sources list contains a useful global list of all sources on all\nplatforms with consistent sorting on all platforms.\nNon-preferred: In some situations, however, it might make sense to\nlist a platform-specific file only in a conditions section that\nspecifically includes it in the sources list:\n  {\n    &#39;targets&#39;: [\n      {\n        &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;foo&#39;,\n        &#39;type&#39;: &#39;executable&#39;,\n        &#39;sources&#39;: [],\n        [&#39;OS == &quot;linux&quot;&#39;, {\n          &#39;sources&#39;: [\n            # Only add to sources list on Linux.\n            &#39;linux_specific.cc&#39;,\n          ]\n        }],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\nThe above two examples end up generating equivalent builds, with the\nsmall exception that the sources lists will list the files in\ndifferent orders.  (The first example defines explicitly where\nlinux_specific.cc appears in the list--perhaps in in the\nmiddle--whereas the second example will always tack it on to the end of\nthe list.)\nIncluding or excluding files using patterns: There are more\ncomplicated ways to construct a sources list based on patterns.  See\nTODO below.\nAdd a new executable\nAn executable program is probably the most straightforward type of\ntarget, since all it typically needs is a list of source files, some\ncompiler/linker settings (probably varied by platform), and some library\ntargets on which it depends and which must be used in the final link.\nAdd an executable that builds on all platforms\nAdd a dictionary defining the new executable target to the targets\nlist in the appropriate .gyp file.  Example:\n  {\n    &#39;targets&#39;: [\n      {\n        &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;new_unit_tests&#39;,\n        &#39;type&#39;: &#39;executable&#39;,\n        &#39;defines&#39;: [\n          &#39;FOO&#39;,\n        ],\n        &#39;include_dirs&#39;: [\n          &#39;..&#39;,\n        ],\n        &#39;dependencies&#39;: [\n          &#39;other_target_in_this_file&#39;,\n          &#39;other_gyp2:target_in_other_gyp2&#39;,\n        ],\n        &#39;sources&#39;: [\n          &#39;new_additional_source.cc&#39;,\n          &#39;new_unit_tests.cc&#39;,\n        ],\n      },\n    ],\n  }\nAdd a platform-specific executable\nAdd a dictionary defining the new executable target to the targets\nlist within an appropriate conditions block for the platform.  The\nconditions block should be a sibling to the top-level targets list:\n  {\n    &#39;targets&#39;: [\n    ],\n    &#39;conditions&#39;: [\n      [&#39;OS==&quot;win&quot;&#39;, {\n        &#39;targets&#39;: [\n          {\n            &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;new_unit_tests&#39;,\n            &#39;type&#39;: &#39;executable&#39;,\n            &#39;defines&#39;: [\n              &#39;FOO&#39;,\n            ],\n            &#39;include_dirs&#39;: [\n              &#39;..&#39;,\n            ],\n            &#39;dependencies&#39;: [\n              &#39;other_target_in_this_file&#39;,\n              &#39;other_gyp2:target_in_other_gyp2&#39;,\n            ],\n            &#39;sources&#39;: [\n              &#39;new_additional_source.cc&#39;,\n              &#39;new_unit_tests.cc&#39;,\n            ],\n          },\n        ],\n      }],\n    ],\n  }\nAdd settings to a target\nThere are several different types of settings that can be defined for\nany given target.\nAdd new preprocessor definitions (-D or /D flags)\nNew preprocessor definitions are added by the defines setting:\n  {\n    &#39;targets&#39;: [\n      {\n        &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;existing_target&#39;,\n        &#39;defines&#39;: [\n          &#39;FOO&#39;,\n          &#39;BAR=some_value&#39;,\n        ],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\nThese may be specified directly in a target&#39;s settings, as in the above\nexample, or in a conditions section.\nAdd a new include directory (-I or /I flags)\nNew include directories are added by the include_dirs setting:\n  {\n    &#39;targets&#39;: [\n      {\n        &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;existing_target&#39;,\n        &#39;include_dirs&#39;: [\n          &#39;..&#39;,\n          &#39;include&#39;,\n        ],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\nThese may be specified directly in a target&#39;s settings, as in the above\nexample, or in a conditions section.\nAdd new compiler flags\nSpecific compiler flags can be added with the cflags setting:\n  {\n    &#39;targets&#39;: [\n      {\n        &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;existing_target&#39;,\n        &#39;conditions&#39;: [\n          [&#39;OS==&quot;win&quot;&#39;, {\n            &#39;cflags&#39;: [\n              &#39;/WX&#39;,\n            ],\n          }, { # OS != &quot;win&quot;\n            &#39;cflags&#39;: [\n              &#39;-Werror&#39;,\n            ],\n          }],\n        ],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\nBecause these flags will be specific to the actual compiler involved,\nthey will almost always be only set within a conditions section.\nAdd new linker flags\nSetting linker flags is OS-specific. On linux and most non-mac posix\nsystems, they can be added with the ldflags setting:\n  {\n    &#39;targets&#39;: [\n      {\n        &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;existing_target&#39;,\n        &#39;conditions&#39;: [\n          [&#39;OS==&quot;linux&quot;&#39;, {\n            &#39;ldflags&#39;: [\n              &#39;-pthread&#39;,\n            ],\n          }],\n        ],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\nBecause these flags will be specific to the actual linker involved,\nthey will almost always be only set within a conditions section.\nOn OS X, linker settings are set via xcode_settings, on Windows via\nmsvs_settings.\nExclude settings on a platform\nAny given settings keyword (defines, include_dirs, etc.) has a\ncorresponding form with a trailing ! (exclamation point) to remove\nvalues from a setting.  One useful example of this is to remove the\nLinux -Werror flag from the global settings defined in\nbuild/common.gypi:\n  {\n    &#39;targets&#39;: [\n      {\n        &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;third_party_target&#39;,\n        &#39;conditions&#39;: [\n          [&#39;OS==&quot;linux&quot;&#39;, {\n            &#39;cflags!&#39;: [\n              &#39;-Werror&#39;,\n            ],\n          }],\n        ],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\nCross-compiling\nGYP has some (relatively limited) support for cross-compiling.\nIf the variable GYP_CROSSCOMPILE or one of the toolchain-related\nvariables (like CC_host or CC_target) is set, GYP will think that\nyou wish to do a cross-compile.\nWhen cross-compiling, each target can be part of a &quot;host&quot; build, a\n&quot;target&quot; build, or both. By default, the target is assumed to be (only)\npart of the &quot;target&quot; build. The &#39;toolsets&#39; property can be set on a\ntarget to change the default.\nA target&#39;s dependencies are assumed to match the build type (so, if A\ndepends on B, by default that means that a target build of A depends on\na target build of B). You can explicitly depend on targets across\ntoolchains by specifying &quot;#host&quot; or &quot;#target&quot; in the dependencies list.\nIf GYP is not doing a cross-compile, the &quot;#host&quot; and &quot;#target&quot; will be\nstripped as needed, so nothing breaks.\nAdd a new library\nTODO:  write intro\nAdd a library that builds on all platforms\nAdd the a dictionary defining the new library target to the targets\nlist in the appropriate .gyp file.

Is so,\nthe type field can be hard-wired appropriately.

This\nsituation is handled by a direct_dependent_settings block:\n  {\n    &#39;targets&#39;: [\n      {\n        &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;foo&#39;,\n        &#39;type&#39;: &#39;executable&#39;,\n        &#39;dependencies&#39;: [\n          &#39;libbar&#39;,\n        ],\n      },\n      {\n        &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;libbar&#39;,\n        &#39;type&#39;: &#39;&lt;(library)&#39;,\n        &#39;defines&#39;: [\n          &#39;LOCAL_DEFINE_FOR_LIBBAR&#39;,\n          &#39;DEFINE_TO_USE_LIBBAR&#39;,\n        ],\n        &#39;include_dirs&#39;: [\n          &#39;..&#39;,\n          &#39;include/libbar&#39;,\n        ],\n        &#39;direct_dependent_settings&#39;: {\n          &#39;defines&#39;: [\n            &#39;DEFINE_TO_USE_LIBBAR&#39;,\n          ],\n          &#39;include_dirs&#39;: [\n            &#39;include/libbar&#39;,\n          ],\n        },\n      },\n    ],\n  }\nIn the above example, the sources of the foo executable will be\ncompiled with the options -DDEFINE_TO_USE_LIBBAR -Iinclude/libbar,\nbecause of those settings&#39; being listed in the\ndirect_dependent_settings block.\nNote that these settings will likely need to be replicated in the\nsettings for the library target itsef, so that the library will build\nwith the same options.  This does not prevent the target from defining\nadditional options for its &quot;internal&quot; use when compiling its own source\nfiles.  (In the above example, these are the LOCAL_DEFINE_FOR_LIBBAR\ndefine, and the .. entry in the include_dirs list.)\nWhen a library depends on an additional library at final link time\n  {\n    &#39;targets&#39;: [\n      {\n        &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;foo&#39;,\n        &#39;type&#39;: &#39;executable&#39;,\n        &#39;dependencies&#39;: [\n          &#39;libbar&#39;,\n        ],\n      },\n      {\n        &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;libbar&#39;,\n        &#39;type&#39;: &#39;&lt;(library)&#39;,\n        &#39;dependencies&#39;: [\n          &#39;libother&#39;\n        ],\n        &#39;export_dependent_settings&#39;: [\n          &#39;libother&#39;\n        ],\n      },\n      {\n        &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;libother&#39;,\n        &#39;type&#39;: &#39;&lt;(library)&#39;,\n        &#39;direct_dependent_settings&#39;: {\n          &#39;defines&#39;: [\n            &#39;DEFINE_FOR_LIBOTHER&#39;,\n          ],\n          &#39;include_dirs&#39;: [\n            &#39;include/libother&#39;,\n          ],\n        },\n      },\n    ],\n  }\nSupport for Mac OS X bundles\ngyp supports building bundles on OS X (.app, .framework, .bundle, etc).\nHere is an example of this:\n    {\n      &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;test_app&#39;,\n      &#39;product_name&#39;: &#39;Test App Gyp&#39;,\n      &#39;type&#39;: &#39;executable&#39;,\n      &#39;mac_bundle&#39;: 1,\n      &#39;sources&#39;: [\n        &#39;main.m&#39;,\n        &#39;TestAppAppDelegate.h&#39;,\n        &#39;TestAppAppDelegate.m&#39;,\n      ],\n      &#39;mac_bundle_resources&#39;: [\n        &#39;TestApp/English.lproj/InfoPlist.strings&#39;,\n        &#39;TestApp/English.lproj/MainMenu.xib&#39;,\n      ],\n      &#39;link_settings&#39;: {\n        &#39;libraries&#39;: [\n          &#39;$(SDKROOT)/System/Library/Frameworks/Cocoa.framework&#39;,\n        ],\n      },\n      &#39;xcode_settings&#39;: {\n        &#39;INFOPLIST_FILE&#39;: &#39;TestApp/TestApp-Info.plist&#39;,\n      },\n    },\nThe mac_bundle key tells gyp that this target should be a bundle.\nexecutable targets get extension .app by default, shared_library\ntargets get .framework – but you can change the bundle extensions by\nsetting product_extension if you want. Files listed in\nmac_bundle_resources will be copied to the bundle&#39;s Resource folder\nof the bundle. You can also set\nprocess_outputs_as_mac_bundle_resources to 1 in actions and rules to\nlet the output of actions and rules be added to that folder (similar to\nprocess_outputs_as_sources).

By convention, single\nquotes are used.\nInteger values, which are represented in decimal without any special\ndecoration.  Integers are fairly rare in input files, but have a few\napplications in boolean contexts, where the convention is to\nrepresent true values with 1 and false with 0.\nLists, which are represented as a sequence of items separated by\ncommas (,) within square brackets ([ and ]).  A list may\ncontain any other primitive types, including other lists.\nGenerally, each item of a list must be of the same type as all other\nitems in the list, but in some cases (such as within conditions\nsections), the list structure is more tightly specified.  A trailing\ncomma is permitted.\nThis example list contains three string values.\n  [ &#39;Generate&#39;, &#39;Your&#39;, &#39;Projects&#39;, ]\n\nDictionaries, which map keys to values.  All keys are strings.\nValues may be of any other primitive type, including other\ndictionaries.  A dictionary is enclosed within curly braces ({ and\n}).  Keys precede values, separated by a colon (:).  Successive\ndictionary entries are separated by commas (,).  A trailing comma\nis permitted.  It is an error for keys to be duplicated within a\nsingle dictionary as written in an input file, although keys may\nreplace other keys during merging.\nThis example dictionary maps each of three keys to different values.\n  {\n    &#39;inputs&#39;: [&#39;version.c.in&#39;],\n    &#39;outputs&#39;: [&#39;version.c&#39;],\n    &#39;process_outputs_as_sources&#39;: 1,\n  }\n\n\nOverall Structure\nA GYP input file is organized as structured data.  At the root scope of\neach .gyp or .gypi (include) file is a dictionary.  The keys and\nvalues of this dictionary, along with any descendants contained within\nthe values, provide the data contained within the file.  This data is\ngiven meaning by interpreting specific key names and their associated\nvalues in specific ways (see Settings Keys).\nComments (#)\nWithin an input file, a comment is introduced by a pound sign (#) not\nwithin a string.  Any text following the pound sign, up until the end of\nthe line, is treated as a comment.\nExample\n{\n  &#39;school_supplies&#39;: [\n    &#39;Marble composition book&#39;,\n    &#39;Sharp #2 pencil&#39;,\n    &#39;Safety scissors&#39;,  # You still shouldn&#39;t run with these\n  ],\n}\nIn this example, the # in &#39;Sharp #2 pencil&#39; is not taken as\nintroducing a comment because it occurs within a string, but the text\nafter &#39;Safety scissors&#39; is treated as a comment having no impact on\nthe data within the file.\nMerging\nMerge Basics (=, ?, +)\nMany operations on GYP input files occurs by merging dictionary and list\nitems together.  During merge operations, it is important to recognize\nthe distinction between source and destination values.  Items from the\nsource value are merged into the destination, which leaves the source\nunchanged and the destination modified by the source.  A dictionary may\nonly be merged into another dictionary, and a list may only be merged\ninto another list.\n\nWhen merging a dictionary, for each key in the source:\nIf the key does not exist in the destination dictionary, insert it\nand copy the associated value directly.\nIf the key does exist:\nIf the associated value is a dictionary, perform the dictionary\nmerging procedure using the source&#39;s and destination&#39;s value\ndictionaries.\nIf the associated value is a list, perform the list merging\nprocedure using the source&#39;s and destination&#39;s value lists.\nIf the associated value is a string or integer, the destination\nvalue is replaced by the source value.\n\n\n\n\nWhen merging a list, merge according to the suffix appended to the\nkey name, if the list is a value within a dictionary.\nIf the key ends with an equals sign (=), the policy is for the\nsource list to completely replace the destination list if it\nexists.  Mnemonic: = for assignment.\nIf the key ends with a question mark (?), the policy is for the\nsource list to be set as the destination list only if the key is\nnot already present in the destination.  Mnemonic: ? for\nconditional assignment.\nIf the key ends with a plus sign (+), the policy is for the\nsource list contents to be prepended to the destination list.\nMnemonic: + for addition or concatenation.\nIf the list key is undecorated, the policy is for the source list\ncontents to be appended to the destination list.  This is the\ndefault list merge policy.\n\n\n\nExample\nSource dictionary:\n{\n  &#39;include_dirs+&#39;: [\n    &#39;shared_stuff/public&#39;,\n  ],\n  &#39;link_settings&#39;: {\n    &#39;libraries&#39;: [\n      &#39;-lshared_stuff&#39;,\n    ],\n  },\n  &#39;test&#39;: 1,\n}\nDestination dictionary:\n{\n  &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;hello&#39;,\n  &#39;sources&#39;: [\n    &#39;kitty.cc&#39;,\n  ],\n  &#39;include_dirs&#39;: [\n    &#39;headers&#39;,\n  ],\n  &#39;link_settings&#39;: {\n    &#39;libraries&#39;: [\n      &#39;-lm&#39;,\n    ],\n    &#39;library_dirs&#39;: [\n      &#39;/usr/lib&#39;,\n    ],\n  },\n  &#39;test&#39;: 0,\n}\nMerged dictionary:\n{\n  &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;hello&#39;,\n  &#39;sources&#39;: [\n    &#39;kitty.cc&#39;,\n  ],\n  &#39;include_dirs&#39;: [\n    &#39;shared_stuff/public&#39;,  # Merged, list item prepended due to include_dirs+\n    &#39;headers&#39;,\n  ],\n  &#39;link_settings&#39;: {\n    &#39;libraries&#39;: [\n      &#39;-lm&#39;,\n      &#39;-lshared_stuff&#39;,  # Merged, list item appended\n    ],\n    &#39;library_dirs&#39;: [\n      &#39;/usr/lib&#39;,\n    ],\n  },\n  &#39;test&#39;: 1,  # Merged, int value replaced\n}\nPathname Relativization\nIn a .gyp or .gypi file, many string values are treated as pathnames\nrelative to the file in which they are defined.\nString values associated with the following keys, or contained within\nlists associated with the following keys, are treated as pathnames:\n\ndestination\nfiles\ninclude_dirs\ninputs\nlibraries\noutputs\nsources\nmac_bundle_resources\nmac_framework_dirs\nmsvs_cygwin_dirs\nmsvs_props\n\nAdditionally, string values associated with keys ending in the following\nsuffixes, or contained within lists associated with keys ending in the\nfollowing suffixes, are treated as pathnames:\n\n_dir\n_dirs\n_file\n_files\n_path\n_paths\n\nHowever, any string value beginning with any of these characters is\nexcluded from pathname relativization:\n\n/ for identifying absolute paths.\n$ for introducing build system variable expansions.\n- to support specifying such items as -llib, meaning “library\nlib in the library search path.”\n&lt;, &gt;, and ! for GYP expansions.\n\nWhen merging such relative pathnames, they are adjusted so that they can\nremain valid relative pathnames, despite being relative to a new home.\nExample\nSource dictionary from ../build/common.gypi:\n{\n  &#39;include_dirs&#39;: [&#39;include&#39;],  # Treated as relative to ../build\n  &#39;libraries&#39;: [&#39;-lz&#39;],  # Not treated as a pathname, begins with a dash\n  &#39;defines&#39;: [&#39;NDEBUG&#39;],  # defines does not contain pathnames\n}\nTarget dictionary, from base.gyp:\n{\n  &#39;sources&#39;: [&#39;string_util.cc&#39;],\n}\nMerged dictionary:\n{\n  &#39;sources&#39;: [&#39;string_util.cc&#39;],\n  &#39;include_dirs&#39;: [&#39;../build/include&#39;],\n  &#39;libraries&#39;: [&#39;-lz&#39;],\n  &#39;defines&#39;: [&#39;NDEBUG&#39;],\n}\nBecause of pathname relativization, after the merge is complete, all of\nthe pathnames in the merged dictionary are valid relative to the\ndirectory containing base.gyp.\nList Singletons\nSome list items are treated as singletons, and the list merge process\nwill enforce special rules when merging them.  At present, any string\nitem in a list that does not begin with a dash (-) is treated as a\nsingleton, although this is subject to change.  When appending or\nprepending a singleton to a list, if the item is already in the list,\nonly the earlier instance is retained in the merged list.\nExample\nSource dictionary:\n{\n  &#39;defines&#39;: [\n    &#39;EXPERIMENT=1&#39;,\n    &#39;NDEBUG&#39;,\n  ],\n}\nDestination dictionary:\n{\n  &#39;defines&#39;: [\n    &#39;NDEBUG&#39;,\n    &#39;USE_THREADS&#39;,\n  ],\n}\nMerged dictionary:\n{\n  &#39;defines&#39;: [\n    &#39;NDEBUG&#39;,\n    &#39;USE_THREADS&#39;,\n    &#39;EXPERIMENT=1&#39;,  # Note that NDEBUG is not appended after this.\n  ],\n}\nIncluding Other Files\nIf the -I (--include) argument was used to invoke GYP, any files\nspecified will be implicitly merged into the root dictionary of all\n.gyp files.\nAn includes section may be placed anywhere within a\n.gyp or .gypi (include) file.  includes sections contain lists of\nother files to include.  They are processed sequentially and merged into\nthe enclosing dictionary at the point that the includes section was\nfound.  includes sections at the root of a .gyp file dictionary are\nmerged after any -I includes from the command line.\nincludes sections are processed immediately after a file is\nloaded, even before variable and conditional\nprocessing, so it is not possible to\ninclude a file based on a variable reference.\nWhile it would be useful to be able to include files based on variable\nexpansions, it is most likely more useful to allow included files access\nto variables set by the files that included them.\nAn includes section may, however, be placed within a\nconditional section.  The included file itself will\nbe loaded unconditionally, but its dictionary will be discarded if the\nassociated condition is not true.\nVariables and Conditionals\nVariables\nThere are three main types of variables within GYP.\n\nPredefined variables.  By convention, these are named with\nCAPITAL_LETTERS.  Predefined variables are set automatically by\nGYP.  They may be overridden, but it is not advisable to do so.  See\nPredefined Variables for a list of\nvariables that GYP provides.\nUser-defined variables.  Within any dictionary, a key named\nvariables can be provided, containing a mapping between variable\nnames (keys) and their contents (values), which may be strings,\nintegers, or lists of strings.  By convention, user-defined\nvariables are named with lowercase_letters.\nAutomatic variables.  Within any dictionary, any key with a string\nvalue has a corresponding automatic variable whose name is the same\nas the key name with an underscore (_) prefixed.  For example, if\nyour dictionary contains type: &#39;static_library&#39;, an automatic\nvariable named _type will be provided, and its value will be a\nstring, &#39;static_library&#39;.\n\nVariables are inherited from enclosing scopes.\nProviding Default Values for Variables (%)\nWithin a variables section, keys named with percent sign (%)\nsuffixes mean that the variable should be set only if it is undefined at\nthe time it is processed.  This can be used to provide defaults for\nvariables that would otherwise be undefined, so that they may reliably\nbe used in variable expansion or conditional\nprocessing.\nPredefined Variables\nEach GYP generator module provides defaults for the following variables:\n\nOS: The name of the operating system that the generator produces\noutput for.  Common values for values for OS are:\n\n&#39;linux&#39;\n&#39;mac&#39;\n&#39;win&#39;\n\nBut other values may be encountered and this list should not be\nconsidered exhaustive.  The gypd (debug) generator module does not\nprovide a predefined value for OS.  When invoking GYP with the\ngypd module, if a value for OS is needed, it must be provided on\nthe command line, such as gyp -f gypd -DOS=mac.\nGYP generators also provide defaults for these variables.  They may\nbe expressed in terms of variables used by the build system that\nthey generate for, often in $(VARIABLE) format.  For example, the\nGYP PRODUCT_DIR variable maps to the Xcode BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR\nvariable, so PRODUCT_DIR is defined by the Xcode generator as\n$(BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR).\n\nEXECUTABLE_PREFIX: A prefix, if any, applied to executable names.\nUsually this will be an empty string.\nEXECUTABLE_SUFFIX: A suffix, if any, applied to executable names.\nOn Windows, this will be .exe, elsewhere, it will usually be an\nempty string.\nINTERMEDIATE_DIR: A directory that can be used to place\nintermediate build results in.  INTERMEDIATE_DIR is only\nguaranteed to be accessible within a single target (See targets).\nThis variable is most useful within the context of rules and actions\n(See rules, See actions).  Compare with SHARED_INTERMEDIATE_DIR.\nPRODUCT_DIR: The directory in which the primary output of each\ntarget, such as executables and libraries, is placed.\nRULE_INPUT_ROOT: The base name for the input file (e.g. &quot;foo&quot;).\nSee Rules.\nRULE_INPUT_EXT: The file extension for the input file (e.g.\n&quot;.cc&quot;).  See Rules.\nRULE_INPUT_NAME: Full name of the input file (e.g. &quot;foo.cc&quot;).\nSee Rules.\nRULE_INPUT_PATH: Full path to the input file (e.g.\n&quot;/bar/foo.cc&quot;).  See Rules.\nSHARED_INTERMEDIATE_DIR: A directory that can be used to place\nintermediate build results in, and have them be accessible to other\ntargets.  Unlike INTERMEDIATE_DIR, each target in a project,\npossibly spanning multiple .gyp files, shares the same\nSHARED_INTERMEDIATE_DIR.\n\nThe following additional predefined variables may be available under\ncertain circumstances:\n\nDEPTH.  When GYP is invoked with a --depth argument, when\nprocessing any .gyp file, DEPTH will be a relative path from the\n.gyp file to the directory specified by the --depth argument.\n\nUser-Defined Variables\nA user-defined variable may be defined in terms of other variables, but\nnot other variables that have definitions provided in the same scope.\nVariable Expansions (&lt;, &gt;, &lt;@, &gt;@)\nGYP provides two forms of variable expansions, “early” or “pre”\nexpansions, and “late,” “post,” or “target” expansions.  They have\nsimilar syntax, differing only in the character used to introduce them.\n\nEarly expansions are introduced by a less-than (&lt;) character.\nMnemonic: the arrow points to the left, earlier on a timeline.\nLate expansions are introduced by a less-than (&gt;) character.\nMnemonic: the arrow points to the right, later on a timeline.\n\nThe difference the two phases of expansion is described in Early and\nLate Phases.\nThese characters were chosen based upon the requirement that they not\nconflict with the variable format used natively by build systems.  While\nthe dollar sign ($) is the most natural fit for variable expansions,\nits use was ruled out because most build systems already use that\ncharacter for their own variable expansions.  Using different characters\nmeans that no escaping mechanism was needed to differentiate between GYP\nvariables and build system variables, and writing build system variables\ninto GYP files is not cumbersome.\nVariables may contain lists or strings, and variable expansions may\noccur in list or string context.  There are variant forms of variable\nexpansions that may be used to determine how each type of variable is to\nbe expanded in each context.\n\nWhen a variable is referenced by &lt;(VAR) or &gt;(VAR):\nIf VAR is a string, the variable reference within the string is\nreplaced by variable&#39;s string value.\nIf VAR is a list, the variable reference within the string is\nreplaced by a string containing the concatenation of all of the\nvariable’s list items.  Generally, the items are joined with\nspaces between each, but the specific behavior is\ngenerator-specific.  The precise encoding used by any generator\nshould be one that would allow each list item to be treated as a\nseparate argument when used as program arguments on the system\nthat the generator produces output for.\n\n\nWhen a variable is referenced by &lt;@(VAR) or &gt;@(VAR):\nThe expansion must occur in list context.\nThe list item must be &#39;&lt;@(VAR)&#39; or &#39;&gt;@(VAR)&#39; exactly.\nIf VAR is a list, each of its elements are inserted into the\nlist in which expansion is taking place, replacing the list item\ncontaining the variable reference.\nIf VAR is a string, the string is converted to a list which is\ninserted into the list in which expansion is taking place as\nabove.  The conversion into a list is generator-specific, but\ngenerally, spaces in the string are taken as separators between\nlist items.  The specific method of converting the string to a\nlist should be the inverse of the encoding method used to expand\nlist variables in string context, above.\n\n\n\nGYP treats references to undefined variables as errors.\nCommand Expansions (&lt;!, &lt;!@)\nCommand expansions function similarly to variable expansions, but\ninstead of resolving variable references, they cause GYP to execute a\ncommand at generation time and use the command’s output as the\nreplacement.  Command expansions are introduced by a less than and\nexclamation mark (&lt;!).\nIn a command expansion, the entire string contained within the\nparentheses is passed to the system’s shell.  The command’s output is\nassigned to a string value that may subsequently be expanded in list\ncontext in the same way as variable expansions if an @ character is\nused.\nIn addition, command expansions (unlike other variable expansions) may\ninclude nested variable expansions.  So something like this is allowed:\n&#39;variables&#39; : [\n  &#39;foo&#39;: &#39;&lt;!(echo Build Date &lt;!(date))&#39;,\n],\nexpands to:\n&#39;variables&#39; : [\n  &#39;foo&#39;: &#39;Build Date 02:10:38 PM Fri Jul 24, 2009 -0700 PDT&#39;,\n],\nYou may also put commands into arrays in order to quote arguments (but\nnote that you need to use a different string quoting character):\n&#39;variables&#39; : [\n  &#39;files&#39;: &#39;&lt;!([&quot;ls&quot;, &quot;-1&quot;, &quot;Filename With Spaces&quot;])&#39;,\n],\nGYP treats command failures (as indicated by a nonzero exit status)\nduring command expansion as errors.\nExample\n{\n  &#39;sources&#39;: [\n    &#39;!(echo filename with space.cc)&#39;,\n  ],\n  &#39;libraries&#39;: [\n    &#39;!@(pkg-config --libs-only-l apr-1)&#39;,\n  ],\n}\nmight expand to:\n{\n  &#39;sources&#39;: [\n    &#39;filename with space.cc&#39;,  # no @, expands into a single string\n  ],\n  &#39;libraries&#39;: [  # @ was used, so there&#39;s a separate list item for each lib\n    &#39;-lapr-1&#39;,\n    &#39;-lpthread&#39;,\n  ],\n}\nConditionals\nConditionals use the same set of variables used for variable expansion.\nAs with variable expansion, there are two phases of conditional\nevaluation:\n\n“Early” or “pre” conditional evaluation, introduced in\nconditions sections.\n“Late,” “post,” or “target” conditional evaluation, introduced in\ntarget_conditions sections.\n\nThe syntax for each type is identical, they differ only in the key name\nused to identify them and the timing of their evaluation.  A more\ncomplete description of syntax and use is provided in\nconditions.\nThe difference the two phases of evaluation is described in Early and\nLate Phases.\nTiming of Variable Expansion and Conditional Evaluation\nEarly and Late Phases\nGYP performs two phases of variable expansion and conditional evaluation:\n\nThe “early” or “pre” phase operates on conditions\nsections and the &lt; form of variable\nexpansions.\nThe “late,” “post,” or “target” phase operates on\ntarget_conditions sections, the &gt; form\nof variable expansions,\nand on the ! form of command\nexpansions).\n\nThese two phases are provided because there are some circumstances in\nwhich each is desirable.\nThe “early” phase is appropriate for most expansions and evaluations.\n“Early” expansions and evaluations may be performed anywhere within any\n.gyp or .gypi file.\nThe “late” phase is appropriate when expansion or evaluation must be\ndeferred until a specific section has been merged into target context.\n“Late” expansions and evaluations only occur within targets sections\nand their descendants.  The typical use case for a late-phase expansion\nis to provide, in some globally-included .gypi file, distinct\nbehaviors depending on the specifics of a target.\nExample\nGiven this input:\n{\n  &#39;target_defaults&#39;: {\n    &#39;target_conditions&#39;: [\n      [&#39;_type==&quot;shared_library&quot;&#39;, {&#39;cflags&#39;: [&#39;-fPIC&#39;]}],\n    ],\n  },\n  &#39;targets&#39;: [\n    {\n      &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;sharing_is_caring&#39;,\n      &#39;type&#39;: &#39;shared_library&#39;,\n    },\n    {\n      &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;static_in_the_attic&#39;,\n      &#39;type&#39;: &#39;static_library&#39;,\n    },\n  ]\n}\nThe conditional needs to be evaluated only in target context; it is\nnonsense outside of target context because no _type variable is\ndefined.  target_conditions allows evaluation\nto be deferred until after the targets sections are\nmerged into their copies of target_defaults.\nThe resulting targets, after “late” phase processing:\n{\n  &#39;targets&#39;: [\n    {\n      &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;sharing_is_caring&#39;,\n      &#39;type&#39;: &#39;shared_library&#39;,\n      &#39;cflags&#39;: [&#39;-fPIC&#39;],\n    },\n    {\n      &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;static_in_the_attic&#39;,\n      &#39;type&#39;: &#39;static_library&#39;,\n    },\n  ]\n}\nExpansion and Evaluation Performed Simultaneously\nDuring any expansion and evaluation phase, both expansion and evaluation\nare performed simultaneously.  The process for handling variable\nexpansions and conditional evaluation within a dictionary is:\n\nLoad automatic variables (those with leading\nunderscores).\nIf a variables section is present, recurse into its\ndictionary.  This allows conditionals to be\npresent within the variables dictionary.\nLoad Variables user-defined variables from the\nvariables section.\nFor each string value in the dictionary, perform variable\nexpansion and, if operating\nduring the “late” phase, command\nexpansions.\nReload automatic variables and Variables\nuser-defined variables because the variable\nexpansion step may have resulted in changes to the automatic\nvariables.\nIf a conditions or\ntarget_conditions section (depending on\nphase) is present, recurse into its dictionary.  This is done after\nvariable expansion so that conditionals may take advantage of\nexpanded automatic variables.\nEvaluate conditionals.\nReload automatic variables and Variables\nuser-defined variables because the conditional\nevaluation step may have resulted in changes to the automatic\nvariables.\nRecurse into child dictionaries or lists that have not yet been\nprocessed.\n\nOne quirk of this ordering is that you cannot expect a\nvariables section within a dictionary’s\nconditional to be effective in the dictionary\nitself, but the added variables will be effective in any child\ndictionaries or lists.  It is thought to be far more worthwhile to\nprovide resolved automatic variables to\nconditional sections, though.  As a workaround, to\nconditionalize variable values, place a conditions or\ntarget_conditions section within the\nvariables section.\nDependencies and Dependents\nIn GYP, “dependents” are targets that rely on other targets, called\n“dependencies.”  Dependents declare their reliance with a special\nsection within their target dictionary,\ndependencies.\nDependent Settings\nIt is useful for targets to “advertise” settings to their dependents.\nFor example, a target might require that all of its dependents add\ncertain directories to their include paths, link against special\nlibraries, or define certain preprocessor macros.  GYP allows these\ncases to be handled gracefully with “dependent settings” sections.\nThere are three types of such sections:\n\ndirect_dependent_settings, which\nadvertises settings to a target&#39;s direct dependents only.\nall_dependent_settings, which\nadvertises settings to all of a target&#39;s dependents, both direct and\nindirect.\nlink_settings, which contains settings that\nshould be applied when a target’s object files are used as linker\ninput.\n\nFurthermore, in some cases, a target needs to pass its dependencies’\nsettings on to its own dependents.  This might happen when a target’s\nown public header files include header files provided by its dependency.\nexport_dependent_settings allows a\ntarget to declare dependencies for which\ndirect_dependent_settings should be\npassed through to its own dependents.\nDependent settings processing merges a copy of the relevant dependent\nsettings dictionary from a dependency into its relevant dependent\ntargets.\nIn most instances,\ndirect_dependent_settings will be\nused.  There are very few cases where\nall_dependent_settings is actually\ncorrect; in most of the cases where it is tempting to use, it would be\npreferable to declare\nexport_dependent_settings.  Most\nlibraries and library_dirs\nsections should be placed within link_settings\nsections.\nExample\nGiven:\n{\n  &#39;targets&#39;: [\n    {\n      &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;cruncher&#39;,\n      &#39;type&#39;: &#39;static_library&#39;,\n      &#39;sources&#39;: [&#39;cruncher.cc&#39;],\n      &#39;direct_dependent_settings&#39;: {\n        &#39;include_dirs&#39;: [&#39;.&#39;],  # dependents need to find cruncher.h.\n      },\n      &#39;link_settings&#39;: {\n        &#39;libraries&#39;: [&#39;-lm&#39;],  # cruncher.cc does math.\n      },\n    },\n    {\n      &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;cruncher_test&#39;,\n      &#39;type&#39;: &#39;executable&#39;,\n      &#39;dependencies&#39;: [&#39;cruncher&#39;],\n      &#39;sources&#39;: [&#39;cruncher_test.cc&#39;],\n    },\n  ],\n}\nAfter dependent settings processing, the dictionary for cruncher_test\nwill be:\n{\n  &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;cruncher_test&#39;,\n  &#39;type&#39;: &#39;executable&#39;,\n  &#39;dependencies&#39;: [&#39;cruncher&#39;],  # implies linking against cruncher\n  &#39;sources&#39;: [&#39;cruncher_test.cc&#39;],\n  &#39;include_dirs&#39;: [&#39;.&#39;]\n  &#39;libraries&#39;: [&#39;-lm&#39;],\n},\nIf cruncher was declared as a shared_library instead of a\nstatic_library, the cruncher_test target would not contain -lm,\nbut instead, cruncher itself would link against -lm.\nLinking Dependencies\nThe precise meaning of a dependency relationship varies with the\ntypes of the targets at either end of the\nrelationship.  In GYP, a dependency relationship can indicate two things\nabout how targets relate to each other:\n\nWhether the dependent target needs to link against the dependency.\nWhether the dependency target needs to be built prior to the\ndependent.  If the former case is true, this case must be true as\nwell.\n\nThe analysis of the first item is complicated by the differences between\nstatic and shared libraries.\n\nStatic libraries are simply collections of object files (.o or\n.obj) that are used as inputs to a linker (ld or link.exe).\nStatic libraries don&#39;t link against other libraries, they’re\ncollected together and used when eventually linking a shared library\nor executable.\nShared libraries are linker output and must undergo symbol\nresolution.  They must link against other libraries (static or\nshared) in order to facilitate symbol resolution.  They may be used\nas libraries in subsequent link steps.\nExecutables are also linker output, and also undergo symbol\nresolution.  Like shared libraries, they must link against static\nand shared libraries to facilitate symbol resolution.  They may not\nbe reused as linker inputs in subsequent link steps.\n\nAccordingly, GYP performs an operation referred to as “static library\ndependency adjustment,” in which it makes each linker output target\n(shared libraries and executables) link against the static libraries it\ndepends on, either directly or indirectly.  Because the linkable targets\nlink against these static libraries, they are also made direct\ndependents of the static libraries.\nAs part of this process, GYP is also able to remove the direct\ndependency relationships between two static library targets, as a\ndependent static library does not actually need to link against a\ndependency static library.  This removal facilitates speedier builds\nunder some build systems, as they are now free to build the two targets\nin parallel.  The removal of this dependency is incorrect in some cases,\nsuch as when the dependency target contains rules or\nactions that generate header files required by the\ndependent target.  In such cases, the dependency target, the one\nproviding the side-effect files, must declare itself as a\nhard_dependency.  This setting instructs GYP to\nnot remove the dependency link between two static library targets in its\ngenerated output.\nLoading Files to Resolve Dependencies\nWhen GYP runs, it loads all .gyp files needed to resolve dependencies\nfound in dependencies sections.  These files are not\nmerged into the files that reference them, but they may contain special\nsections that are merged into dependent target dictionaries.\nBuild Configurations\nExplain this.\nList Filters\nGYP allows list items to be filtered by “exclusions” and “patterns.”\nAny list containing string values in a dictionary may have this\nfiltering applied.  For the purposes of this section, a list modified by\nexclusions or patterns is referred to as a “base list”, in contrast to\nthe “exclusion list” and “pattern list” that operates on it.\n\nFor a base list identified by key name key, the key! list\nprovides exclusions.\nFor a base list identified by key name key, the key/ list\nprovides regular expression pattern-based filtering.\n\nBoth key! and key/ may be present.  The key! exclusion list will\nbe processed first, followed by the key/ pattern list.\nExclusion lists are most powerful when used in conjunction with\nconditionals.\nExclusion Lists (!)\nAn exclusion list provides a way to remove items from the related list\nbased on exact matching.  Any item found in an exclusion list will be\nremoved from the corresponding base list.\nExample\nThis example excludes files from the sources based on the setting of\nthe OS variable.\n{\n  &#39;sources:&#39; [\n    &#39;mac_util.mm&#39;,\n    &#39;win_util.cc&#39;,\n  ],\n  &#39;conditions&#39;: [\n    [&#39;OS==&quot;mac&quot;&#39;, {&#39;sources!&#39;: [&#39;win_util.cc&#39;]}],\n    [&#39;OS==&quot;win&quot;&#39;, {&#39;sources!&#39;: [&#39;mac_util.cc&#39;]}],\n  ],\n}\nPattern Lists (/)\nPattern lists are similar to, but more powerful than, exclusion\nlists).  Each item in a pattern list is itself\na two-element list.  The first item is a string, either &#39;include&#39; or\n&#39;exclude&#39;, specifying the action to take.  The second item is a string\nspecifying a regular expression.  Any item in the base list matching the\nregular expression pattern will either be included or excluded, based on\nthe action specified.\nItems in a pattern list are processed in sequence, and an excluded item\nthat is later included will not be removed from the list (unless it is\nsubsequently excluded again.)\nPattern lists are processed after exclusion\nlists), so it is possible for a pattern list to\nre-include items previously excluded by an exclusion list.\nNothing is actually removed from a base list until all items in an\nexclusion list) and pattern list have been\nevaluated.  This allows items to retain their correct position relative\nto one another even after being excluded and subsequently included.\nExample\nIn this example, a uniform naming scheme is adopted for\nplatform-specific files.\n{\n  &#39;sources&#39;: [\n    &#39;io_posix.cc&#39;,\n    &#39;io_win.cc&#39;,\n    &#39;launcher_mac.cc&#39;,\n    &#39;main.cc&#39;,\n    &#39;platform_util_linux.cc&#39;,\n    &#39;platform_util_mac.mm&#39;,\n  ],\n  &#39;sources/&#39;: [\n    [&#39;exclude&#39;, &#39;_win\\\\.cc$&#39;],\n  ],\n  &#39;conditions&#39;: [\n    [&#39;OS!=&quot;linux&quot;&#39;, {&#39;sources/&#39;: [[&#39;exclude&#39;, &#39;_linux\\\\.cc$&#39;]]}],\n    [&#39;OS!=&quot;mac&quot;&#39;, {&#39;sources/&#39;: [[&#39;exclude&#39;, &#39;_mac\\\\.cc|mm?$&#39;]]}],\n    [&#39;OS==&quot;win&quot;&#39;, {&#39;sources/&#39;: [\n      [&#39;include&#39;, &#39;_win\\\\.cc$&#39;],\n      [&#39;exclude&#39;, &#39;_posix\\\\.cc$&#39;],\n    ]}],\n  ],\n}\nAfter the pattern list is applied, sources will have the following\nvalues, depending on the setting of OS:\n\nWhen OS is linux: [&#39;io_posix.cc&#39;, &#39;main.cc&#39;,\n&#39;platform_util_linux.cc&#39;]\nWhen OS is mac: [&#39;io_posix.cc&#39;, &#39;launcher_mac.cc&#39;, &#39;main.cc&#39;,\n&#39;platform_util_mac.mm&#39;]\nWhen OS is win: [&#39;io_win.cc&#39;, &#39;main.cc&#39;,\n&#39;platform_util_win.cc&#39;]\n\nNote that when OS is win, the include for _win.cc files is\nprocessed after the exclude matching the same pattern, because the\nsources/ list participates in merging during\nconditional evaluation just like any other list\nwould.  This guarantees that the _win.cc files, previously\nunconditionally excluded, will be re-included when OS is win.\nLocating Excluded Items\nIn some cases, a GYP generator needs to access to items that were\nexcluded by an exclusion list) or pattern\nlist).  When GYP excludes items during processing\nof either of these list types, it places the results in an _excluded\nlist.  In the example above, when OS is mac, sources_excluded\nwould be set to [&#39;io_win.cc&#39;, &#39;platform_util_linux.cc&#39;].  Some GYP\ngenerators use this feature to display excluded files in the project\nfiles they generate for the convenience of users, who may wish to refer\nto other implementations.\nProcessing Order\nGYP uses a defined and predictable order to execute the various steps\nperformed between loading files and generating output.\n\nLoad files.\nLoad .gyp files.  Merge any command-line\nincludes into each .gyp file’s root\ndictionary.  As includes are found,\nload them as well and merge them into the scope in\nwhich the includes section was found.\nPerform “early” or “pre” variable\nexpansion and conditional\nevaluation.\nMerge each target’s dictionary into\nthe .gyp file’s root target_defaults\ndictionary.\nScan each target for\ndependencies, and repeat the above steps for\nany newly-referenced .gyp files not yet loaded.\n\n\nScan each target for wildcard\ndependencies, expanding the wildcards.\nProcess dependent settings.  These\nsections are processed, in order:\nall_dependent_settings\ndirect_dependent_settings\nlink_dependent_settings\n\n\nPerform static library dependency\nadjustment.\nPerform “late,” “post,” or “target”\nvariable expansion and conditional\nevaluation on target\ndictionaries.\nMerge target settings into\nconfigurations as appropriate.\nProcess exclusion and pattern\nlists.\n\nSettings Keys\nSettings that may appear anywhere\nconditions\nList of condition items\nA conditions section introduces a subdictionary that is only merged\ninto the enclosing scope based on the evaluation of a conditional\nexpression.  Each condition within a conditions list is itself a\nlist of at least two items:\n\nA string containing the conditional expression itself.  Conditional\nexpressions may take the following forms:\nFor string values, var==&quot;value&quot; and var!=&quot;value&quot; to test\nequality and inequality.  For example, &#39;OS==&quot;linux&quot;&#39; is true\nwhen the OS variable is set to &quot;linux&quot;.\nFor integer values, var==value, var!=value, var&lt;value,\nvar&lt;=value, var&gt;=value, and var&gt;value, to test equality and\nseveral common forms of inequality.  For example,\n&#39;chromium_code==0&#39; is true when the chromium_code variable is\nset to 0.\nIt is an error for a conditional expression to reference any\nundefined variable.\n\n\nA dictionary containing the subdictionary to be merged into the\nenclosing scope if the conditional expression evaluates to true.\n\nThese two items can be followed by any number of similar two items that\nwill be evaluated if the previous conditional expression does not\nevaluate to true.\nAn additional optional dictionary can be appended to this sequence of\ntwo items.  This optional dictionary will be merged into the enclosing\nscope if none of the conditional expressions evaluate to true.\nWithin a conditions section, each item is processed sequentially, so\nit is possible to predict the order in which operations will occur.\nThere is no restriction on nesting conditions sections.\nconditions sections are very similar to target_conditions sections.\nSee target_conditions.\nExample\n{\n  &#39;sources&#39;: [\n    &#39;common.cc&#39;,\n  ],\n  &#39;conditions&#39;: [\n    [&#39;OS==&quot;mac&quot;&#39;, {&#39;sources&#39;: [&#39;mac_util.mm&#39;]}],\n    [&#39;OS==&quot;win&quot;&#39;, {&#39;sources&#39;: [&#39;win_main.cc&#39;]}, {&#39;sources&#39;: [&#39;posix_main.cc&#39;]}],\n    [&#39;OS==&quot;mac&quot;&#39;, {&#39;sources&#39;: [&#39;mac_impl.mm&#39;]},\n     &#39;OS==&quot;win&quot;&#39;, {&#39;sources&#39;: [&#39;win_impl.cc&#39;]},\n     {&#39;sources&#39;: [&#39;default_impl.cc&#39;]}\n    ],\n  ],\n}\nGiven this input, the sources list will take on different values based\non the OS variable.\n\nIf OS is &quot;mac&quot;, sources will contain [&#39;common.cc&#39;,\n&#39;mac_util.mm&#39;, &#39;posix_main.cc&#39;, &#39;mac_impl.mm&#39;].\nIf OS is &quot;win&quot;, sources will contain [&#39;common.cc&#39;,\n&#39;win_main.cc&#39;, &#39;win_impl.cc&#39;].\nIf OS is any other value such as &quot;linux&quot;, sources will contain\n[&#39;common.cc&#39;, &#39;posix_main.cc&#39;, &#39;default_impl.cc&#39;].\n\n"},"docs/LanguageSpecification.html":{"url":"docs/LanguageSpecification.html","title":"Language specification","body":"Language Specification\n[TOC]\nObjective\nCreate a tool for the Chromium project that generates native Visual Studio,\nXcode and SCons and/or make build files from a platform-independent input\nformat.  Make the input format as reasonably general as possible without\nspending extra time trying to &quot;get everything right,&quot; except where not doing so\nwould likely lead Chromium to an eventual dead end.  When in doubt, do what\nChromium needs and don&#39;t worry about generalizing the solution.\nBackground\nNumerous other projects, both inside and outside Google, have tried to\ncreate a simple, universal cross-platform build representation that\nstill allows sufficient per-platform flexibility to accommodate\nirreconcilable differences.  The fact that no obvious working candidate\nexists that meets Chromium&#39;s requirements indicates this is probably a\ntougher problem than it appears at first glance.  We aim to succeed by\ncreating a tool that is highly specific to Chromium&#39;s specific use case,\nnot to the general case of design a completely platform-independent tool\nfor expressing any possible build.\nThe Mac has the most sophisticated model for application development\nthrough an IDE.  Consequently, we will use the Xcode model as the\nstarting point (the input file format must handle Chromium&#39;s use of\nXcode seamlessly) and adapt the design as necessary for the other\nplatforms.\nOverview\nThe overall design has the following characteristics:\n\nInput configurations are specified in files with the suffix .gyp.\nEach .gyp file specifies how to build the targets for the\n&quot;component&quot; defined by that file.\nEach .gyp file generates one or more output files appropriate to\nthe platform:\nOn Mac, a .gyp file generates one Xcode .xcodeproj bundle with\ninformation about how its targets are built.\nOn Windows, a .gyp file generates one Visual Studio .sln file,\nand one Visual Studio .vcproj file per target.\nOn Linux, a .gyp file generates one SCons file and/or one\nMakefile per target\n\n\nThe .gyp file syntax is a Python data structure.\nUse of arbitrary Python in .gyp files is forbidden.\nUse of eval() with restricted globals and locals on .gyp file\ncontents restricts the input to an evaluated expression, not\narbitrary Python statements.\nAll input is expected to comply with JSON, with two exceptions:\nthe # character (not inside strings) begins a comment that lasts\nuntil the end of the line, and trailing commas are permitted at\nthe end of list and dict contents.\n\n\nInput data is a dictionary of keywords and values.\n&quot;Invalid&quot; keywords on any given data structure are not illegal,\nthey&#39;re just ignored.\nTODO:  providing warnings on use of illegal keywords would help\nusers catch typos.  Figure out something nice to do with this.\n\n\n\nDetailed Design\nSome up-front design principles/thoughts/TODOs:\n\nRe-use keywords consistently.\nKeywords that allow configuration of a platform-specific concept get\nprefixed appropriately:\nExamples:  msvs_disabled_warnings, xcode_framework_dirs\n\n\nThe input syntax is declarative and data-driven.\nThis gets enforced by using Python eval() (which only evaluates\nan expression) instead of exec (which executes arbitrary python)\n\n\nSemantic meanings of specific keyword values get deferred until all\nare read and the configuration is being evaluated to spit out the\nappropriate file(s)\nSource file lists:\nAre flat lists.  Any imposed ordering within the .gyp file (e.g.\nalphabetically) is purely by convention and for developer\nconvenience.  When source files are linked or archived together,\nit is expected that this will occur in the order that files are\nlisted in the .gyp file.\nSource file lists contain no mechanism for by-hand folder\nconfiguration (Filter tags in Visual Studio, Groups in Xcode)\nA folder hierarchy is created automatically that mirrors the file\nsystem\n\n\n\nExample\n{\n  &#39;target_defaults&#39;: {\n    &#39;defines&#39;: [\n      &#39;U_STATIC_IMPLEMENTATION&#39;,\n      [&#39;LOGFILE&#39;, &#39;foo.log&#39;,],\n    ],\n    &#39;include_dirs&#39;: [\n      &#39;..&#39;,\n    ],\n  },\n  &#39;targets&#39;: [\n    {\n      &#39;target_name&#39;: &#39;foo&#39;,\n      &#39;type&#39;: &#39;static_library&#39;,\n      &#39;sources&#39;: [\n        &#39;foo/src/foo.cc&#39;,\n        &#39;foo/src/foo_main.cc&#39;,\n      ],\n      &#39;include_dirs&#39;: [\n         &#39;foo&#39;,\n         &#39;foo/include&#39;,\n      ],\n      &#39;conditions&#39;: [\n         [ &#39;OS==mac&#39;, { &#39;sources&#39;: [ &#39;platform_test_mac.mm&#39; ] } ]\n      ],\n      &#39;direct_dependent_settings&#39;: {\n        &#39;defines&#39;: [\n          &#39;UNIT_TEST&#39;,\n        ],\n        &#39;include_dirs&#39;: [\n          &#39;foo&#39;,\n          &#39;foo/include&#39;,\n        ],\n      },\n    },\n  ],\n}\nStructural Elements\nTop-level Dictionary\nThis is the single dictionary in the .gyp file that defines the\ntargets and how they&#39;re to be built.\nThe following keywords are meaningful within the top-level dictionary\ndefinition:\n|:-------------     |:------------------|\n| conditions      | A conditional section that may contain other items that can be present in a top-level dictionary, on a conditional basis.  See the &quot;Conditionals&quot; section below. |\n| includes        | A list of .gypi files to be included in the top-level dictionary. |\n| target_defaults | A dictionary of default settings to be inherited by all targets in the top-level dictionary.  See the &quot;Settings keywords&quot; section below. |\n| targets         | A list of target specifications.  See the &quot;targets&quot; below. |\n| variables       | A dictionary containing variable definitions.  Each key in this dictionary is the name of a variable, and each value must be a string value that the variable is to be set to. |\ntargets\nA list of dictionaries defining targets to be built by the files\ngenerated from this .gyp file.\nTargets may contain includes, conditions, and variables sections\nas permitted in the root dictionary. The following additional keywords\nhave structural meaning for target definitions:\n|:----------                   |:------------------------------------------|\n| actions                    | A list of special custom actions to perform on a specific input file, or files, to produce output files.  See the &quot;Actions&quot; section below. |\n| all_dependent_settings     | A dictionary of settings to be applied to all dependents of the target, transitively.  This includes direct dependents and the entire set of their dependents, and so on.  This section may contain anything found within a target dictionary, except configurations, target_name, and type sections.  Compare direct_dependent_settings and link_settings. |\n| configurations             | A list of dictionaries defining build configurations for the target.  See the &quot;Configurations&quot; section below.  |\n| copies                     | A list of copy actions to perform. See the &quot;Copies&quot; section below. |\n| defines                    | A list of preprocesor definitions to be passed on the command line to the C/C++ compiler (via -D or /D options). |\n| dependencies               | A list of targets on which this target depends.  Targets in other .gyp files are specified as ../path/to/other.gyp:target_we_want. |\n| direct_dependent_settings  | A dictionary of settings to be applied to other targets that depend on this target.  These settings will only be applied to direct dependents.  This section may contain anything found within a target dictionary, except configurations, target_name, and type sections.  Compare with all_dependent_settings and link_settings. |\n| include_dirs               | A list of include directories to be passed on the command line to the C/C++ compiler (via -I or /I options). |\n| libraries                  | A list of list of libraries (and/or frameworks) on which this target depends. |\n| link_settings              | A dictionary of settings to be applied to targets in which this target&#39;s contents are linked.  executable and shared_library targets are linkable, so if they depend on a non-linkable target such as a static_library, they will adopt its link_settings.  This section can contain anything found within a target dictionary, except configurations, target_name, and type sections.  Compare all_dependent_settings and direct_dependent_settings. |\n| rules                      | A special custom action to perform on a list of input files, to produce output files.  See the &quot;Rules&quot; section below. |\n| sources                    | A list of source files that are used to build this target or which should otherwise show up in the IDE for this target.  In practice, we expect this list to be a union of all files necessary to build the target on all platforms, as well as other related files that aren&#39;t actually used for building, like README files. |\n| target_conditions          | Like conditions, but evaluation is delayed until the settings have been merged into an actual target.  target_conditions may be used to place conditionals into a target_defaults section but have them still depend on specific target settings. |\n| target_name                | The name of a target being defined. |\n| type                       | The type of target being defined. This field currently supports executable, static_library, shared_library, and none.  The none target type is useful when producing output which is not linked. For example, converting raw translation files into resources or documentation into platform specific help files. |\n| msvs_props                 | A list of Visual Studio property sheets (.vsprops files) to be used to build the target. |\n| xcode_config_file          | An Xcode configuration (.xcconfig file) to be used to build the target. |\n| xcode_framework_dirs       | A list of framework directories be used to build the target. |\nYou can affect the way that lists/dictionaries are merged together (for\nexample the way a list in target_defaults interacts with the same named\nlist in the target itself) with a couple of special characters, which\nare covered in Merge\nBasics.md) and List\nFilters on the\nInputFormatReference page.\nconfigurations\nconfigurations sections may be found within targets or\ntarget_defaults sections.  The configurations section is a list of\ndictionaries specifying different build configurations.  Because\nconfigurations are implemented as lists, it is not currently possible to\noverride aspects of configurations that are imported into a target from\na target_defaults section.\nNOTE: It is extremely important that each target within a project define\nthe same set of configurations.  This continues to apply even when a\nproject spans across multiple .gyp files.\nA configuration dictionary may contain anything that can be found within\na target dictionary, except for actions, all_dependent_settings,\nconfigurations, dependencies, direct_dependent_settings,\nlibraries, link_settings, sources, target_name, and type.\nConfiguration dictionaries may also contain these elements:\n|:---------------------|:----------------------------------------------------|\n| configuration_name | Required attribute.  The name of the configuration. |\nConditionals\nConditionals may appear within any dictionary in a .gyp file.  There\nare two tpes of conditionals, which differ only in the timing of their\nprocessing.  conditons sections are processed shortly after loading\n.gyp files, and target_conditons sections are processed after all\ndependencies have been computed.\nA conditional section is introduced with a conditions or\ntarget_conditions dictionary keyword, and is composed of a list.  Each\nlist contains two or three elements.  The first two elements, which are\nalways required, are the conditional expression to evaluate and a\ndictionary containing settings to merge into the dictionary containing\nthe conditions or target_conditions section if the expression\nevaluates to true.  The third, optional, list element is a dictionary to\nmerge if the expression evaluates to false.\nThe eval() of the expression string takes place in the context of\nglobal and/or local dictionaries that constructed from the .gyp input\ndata, and overrides the __builtin__ dictionary, to prevent the\nexecution of arbitrary Python code.\nActions\nAn actions section provides a list of custom build actions to perform\non inputs, producing outputs.  The actions section is organized as a\nlist.  Each item in the list is a dictionary having the following form:\n|:--------------|:-------|:-----------------------------|\n| action_name | string | The name of the action.  Depending on how actions are implemented in the various generators, some may desire or require this property to be set to a unique name; others may ignore this property entirely. |\n| inputs      | list   | A list of pathnames treated as inputs to the custom action. |\n| outputs     | list   | A list of pathnames that the custom action produces. |\n| action      | list   | A command line invocation used to produce outputs from inputs.  For maximum cross-platform compatibility, invocations that require a Python interpreter should be specified with a first element &quot;python&quot;.  This will enable generators for environments with specialized Python installations to be able to perform the action in an appropriate Python environment. |\n| message     | string | A message to be displayed to the user by the build system when the action is run. |\nBuild environments will compare inputs and outputs.  If any output\nis missing or is outdated relative to any input, the custom action\nwill be invoked.  If all outputs are present and newer than all\ninputs, the outputs are considered up-to-date and the action need\nnot be invoked.\nActions are implemented in Xcode as shell script build phases performed\nprior to the compilation phase.  In the Visual Studio generator, actions\nappear files with a FileConfiguration containing a custom\nVCCustomBuildTool specifying the remainder of the inputs, the outputs,\nand the action.\nCombined with variable expansions, actions can be quite powerful.  Here\nis an example action that leverages variable expansions to minimize\nduplication of pathnames:\n      &#39;sources&#39;: [\n        # libraries.cc is generated by the js2c action below.\n        &#39;&lt;(INTERMEDIATE_DIR)/libraries.cc&#39;,\n      ],\n      &#39;actions&#39;: [\n        {\n          &#39;variables&#39;: {\n            &#39;core_library_files&#39;: [\n              &#39;src/runtime.js&#39;,\n              &#39;src/v8natives.js&#39;,\n              &#39;src/macros.py&#39;,\n            ],\n          },\n          &#39;action_name&#39;: &#39;js2c&#39;,\n          &#39;inputs&#39;: [\n            &#39;tools/js2c.py&#39;,\n            &#39;&lt;@(core_library_files)&#39;,\n          ],\n          &#39;outputs&#39;: [\n            &#39;&lt;(INTERMEDIATE_DIR)/libraries.cc&#39;,\n            &#39;&lt;(INTERMEDIATE_DIR)/libraries-empty.cc&#39;,\n          ],\n          &#39;action&#39;: [&#39;python&#39;, &#39;tools/js2c.py&#39;, &#39;&lt;@(_outputs)&#39;, &#39;CORE&#39;, &#39;&lt;@(core_library_files)&#39;],\n        },\n      ],\nRules\nA rules section provides custom build action to perform on inputs, producing\noutputs.  The rules section is organized as a list.  Each item in the list is\na dictionary having the following form:\n|:------------|:-------|:-----------------------------------------|\n| rule_name | string | The name of the rule.  Depending on how Rules are implemented in the various generators, some may desire or require this property to be set to a unique name; others may ignore this property entirely. |\n| extension | string | All source files of the current target with the given extension will be treated successively as inputs to the rule. |\n| inputs    | list   | Additional dependencies of the rule. |\n| outputs   | list   | A list of pathnames that the rule produces. Has access to RULE_INPUT_ variables (see below). |\n| action    | list   | A command line invocation used to produce outputs from inputs.  For maximum cross-platform compatibility, invocations that require a Python interpreter should be specified with a first element &quot;python&quot;.  This will enable generators for environments with specialized Python installations to be able to perform the action in an appropriate Python environment. Has access to RULE_INPUT_ variables (see below). |\n| message   | string | A message to be displayed to the user by the build system when the action is run. Has access to RULE_INPUT_ variables (see below). |\nThere are several variables available to outputs, action, and message.\n|:---------------------|:------------------------------------|\n| RULE_INPUT_PATH    | The full path to the current input. |\n| RULE_INPUT_DIRNAME | The directory of the current input. |\n| RULE_INPUT_NAME    | The file name of the current input. |\n| RULE_INPUT_ROOT    | The file name of the current input without extension. |\n| RULE_INPUT_EXT     | The file name extension of the current input. |\nRules can be thought of as Action generators. For each source selected\nby extension an special action is created. This action starts out with\nthe same inputs, outputs, action, and message as the rule. The\nsource is added to the action&#39;s inputs. The outputs, action, and\nmessage are then handled the same but with the additional variables.\nIf the _output variable is used in the action or message the\nRULE_INPUT_ variables in output will be expanded for the current\nsource.\nCopies\nA copies section provides a simple means of copying files.  The\ncopies section is organized as a list.  Each item in the list is a\ndictionary having the following form:\n|:--------------|:-------|:------------------------------|\n| destination | string | The directory into which the files will be copied. |\n| files       | list   | A list of files to be copied. |\nThe copies will be created in destination and have the same file name\nas the file they are copied from. Even if the files are from multiple\ndirectories they will all be copied into the destination directory.\nEach destination file has an implicit build dependency on the file it\nis copied from.\nGenerated Xcode .pbxproj Files\nWe derive the following things in a project.pbxproj plist file within\nan .xcodeproj bundle from the above input file formats as follows:\n\nGroup hierarchy: This is generated in a fixed format with contents\nderived from the input files. There is no provision for the user to\nspecify additional groups or create a custom hierarchy.\nConfiguration group: This will be used with the\nxcode_config_file property above, if needed.\nSource group: The union of the sources lists of all targets\nafter applying appropriate conditions.  The resulting list is\nsorted and put into a group hierarchy that matches the layout of\nthe directory tree on disk, with a root of // (the top of the\nhierarchy).\nFrameworks group: Taken directly from libraries value for the\ntarget, after applying appropriate conditions.\nProjects group: References to other .xcodeproj bundles that\nare needed by the .xcodeproj in which the group is contained.\nProducts group: Output from the various targets.\n\n\nProject References:\nProject Configurations:\nPer-.xcodeproj file settings are not supported, all settings are\napplied at the target level.\n\n\nTargets:\nPhases: Copy sources, link with libraries/frameworks, ...\nTarget Configurations: Specified by input.\nDependencies: (local and remote)\n\n\n\nGenerated Visual Studio .vcproj Files\nWe derive the following sections in a .vcproj file from the above\ninput file formats as follows:\n\nVisualStudioProject:\nPlatforms:\nToolFiles:\nConfigurations:\nConfiguration:\n\n\nReferences:\nFiles:\nFilter:\nFile:\nFileConfiguration:\nTool:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobals:\n\n\n\nGenerated Visual Studio .sln Files\nWe derive the following sections in a .sln file from the above input\nfile formats as follows:\n\nProjects:\nWebsiteProperties:\nProjectDependencies:\n\n\nGlobal:\nSolutionConfigurationPlatforms:\nProjectConfigurationPlatforms:\nSolutionProperties:\nNestedProjects:\n\n\n\nCaveats\nNotes/Question from very first prototype draft of the language.\nMake sure these issues are addressed somewhere before deleting.\n\nLibraries are easy, application abstraction is harder\nApplications involves resource compilation\nApplications involve many inputs\nApplications include transitive closure of dependencies\n\n\nSpecific use cases like cc_library\nMac compiles more than just .c/.cpp files (specifically, .m and .mm\nfiles)\nCompiler options vary by:\nFile type\nTarget type\nIndividual file\n\n\nFiles may have custom settings per file per platform, but we probably\ndon&#39;t care or need to support this in gyp.\n\n\nWill all linked non-Chromium projects always use the same versions of every\nsubsystem?\nVariants are difficult.  We&#39;ve identified the following variants (some\nspecific to Chromium, some typical of other projects in the same ballpark):\nTarget platform\nV8 vs. JSC\nDebug vs. Release\nToolchain (VS version, gcc, version)\nHost platform\nL10N\nVendor\nPurify / Valgrind\n\n\nWill everyone upgrade VS at once?\nWhat does a dylib dependency mean?\n\n"},"docs/Hacking.html":{"url":"docs/Hacking.html","title":"Hacking","body":"Hacking\n[TOC]\nNote that the instructions below assume that you have the Chromium\ndepot tools\ninstalled and configured.\nIf you don&#39;t, you do not pass go, and you cannot collect your $200.\nGetting the sources\nGit is required to hack on anything, you can set up a git clone of GYP\nas follows (assuming depot_tools is in your path):\nmkdir foo\ncd foo\nfetch gyp\ncd gyp\n(this will create foo/.gclient and clone gyp underneath it into foo/gyp.\nfoo can be any directory name you want.

This can be handy to\ninspect intermediate data when debugging a test.\nYou can also set PRESERVE_PASS=1, PRESERVE_FAIL=1 or PRESERVE_NO_RESULT=1\nto preserve output for tests that fall into one of those categories.\nSpecifying the format (build tool) to use\nBy default, the gyptest.py script will generate configurations for\nthe &quot;primary&quot; supported build tool for the platform you&#39;re on:\nVisual Studio on Windows,\nXcode on Mac,\nand (currently) SCons on Linux.\nAn alternate format (build tool) may be specified\nusing the -f option:\n  $ python gyptest.py -f make test/hello/gyptest-all.py\n  PYTHONPATH=/home/knight/src/gyp/trunk/test/lib\n  TESTGYP_FORMAT=make\n  /usr/bin/python test/hello/gyptest-all.py\n  PASSED\n  $\nMultiple tools may be specified in a single pass as\na comma-separated list:\n  $ python gyptest.py -f make,scons test/hello/gyptest-all.py\n  PYTHONPATH=/home/knight/src/gyp/trunk/test/lib\n  TESTGYP_FORMAT=make\n  /usr/bin/python test/hello/gyptest-all.py\n  PASSED\n  TESTGYP_FORMAT=scons\n  /usr/bin/python test/hello/gyptest-all.py\n  PASSED\n  $\nTest script functions and methods\nThe TestGyp class contains a lot of functionality\nintended to make it easy to write tests.\nThis section describes the most useful pieces for GYP testing.\n(The TestGyp class is actually a subclass of more generic\nTestCommon and TestCmd base classes\nthat contain even more functionality than is\ndescribed here.)\nInitialization\nThe standard initialization formula is:\n  import TestGyp\n  test = TestGyp.TestGyp()\nThis copies the contents of the directory tree in which\nthe test script lives to a temporary directory for execution,\nand arranges for the temporary directory&#39;s removal on exit.\nBy default, any comparisons of output or file contents\nmust be exact matches for the test to pass.\nIf you need to use regular expressions for matches,\na useful alternative initialization is:\n  import TestGyp\n  test = TestGyp.TestGyp(match = TestGyp.match_re,\n                         diff = TestGyp.diff_re)`\nRunning GYP\nThe canonical invocation is to simply specify the .gyp file to be executed:\n  test.run_gyp(&#39;file.gyp&#39;)\nAdditional GYP arguments may be specified:\n  test.run_gyp(&#39;file.gyp&#39;, arguments=[&#39;arg1&#39;, &#39;arg2&#39;, ...])\nTo execute GYP from a subdirectory (where, presumably, the specified file\nlives):\n  test.run_gyp(&#39;file.gyp&#39;, chdir=&#39;subdir&#39;)\nRunning the build tool\nRunning the build tool requires passing in a .gyp file, which may be used to\ncalculate the name of a specific build configuration file (such as a MSVS\nsolution file corresponding to the .gyp file).\nThere are several different .build_*() methods for invoking different types\nof builds.\nTo invoke a build tool with an explicit all target (or equivalent):\n  test.build_all(&#39;file.gyp&#39;)\nTo invoke a build tool with its default behavior (for example, executing make\nwith no targets specified):\n  test.build_default(&#39;file.gyp&#39;)\nTo invoke a build tool with an explicit specified target:\n  test.build_target(&#39;file.gyp&#39;, &#39;target&#39;)\nRunning executables\nThe most useful method executes a program built by the GYP-generated\nconfiguration:\n  test.run_built_executable(&#39;program&#39;)\nThe .run_built_executable() method will account for the actual built target\noutput location for the build tool being tested, as well as tack on any\nnecessary executable file suffix for the platform (for example .exe on\nWindows).\nstdout= and stderr= keyword arguments specify expected standard output and\nerror output, respectively.  Failure to match these (if specified) will cause\nthe test to fail.  An explicit None value will suppress that verification:\n  test.run_built_executable(&#39;program&#39;,\n                            stdout=&quot;expect this output\\n&quot;,\n                            stderr=None)\nNote that the default values are stdout=None and stderr=&#39;&#39; (that is, no\ncheck for standard output, and error output must be empty).\nArbitrary executables (not necessarily those built by GYP) can be executed with\nthe lower-level .run() method:\n  test.run(&#39;program&#39;)\nThe program must be in the local directory (that is, the temporary directory\nfor test execution) or be an absolute path name.\nFetching command output\n  test.stdout()\nReturns the standard output from the most recent executed command (including\n.run_gyp(), .build_*(), or .run*() methods).\n  test.stderr()\nReturns the error output from the most recent executed command (including\n.run_gyp(), .build_*(), or .run*() methods).\nVerifying existence or non-existence of files or directories\n  test.must_exist(&#39;file_or_dir&#39;)\nVerifies that the specified file or directory exists, and fails the test if it\ndoesn&#39;t.\n  test.must_not_exist(&#39;file_or_dir&#39;)\nVerifies that the specified file or directory does not exist, and fails the\ntest if it does.\nVerifying file contents\n  test.must_match(&#39;file&#39;, &#39;expected content\\n&#39;)\nVerifies that the content of the specified file match the expected string, and\nfails the test if it does not.  By default, the match must be exact, but\nline-by-line regular expressions may be used if the TestGyp object was\ninitialized with TestGyp.match_re.\n  test.must_not_match(&#39;file&#39;, &#39;expected content\\n&#39;)\nVerifies that the content of the specified file does not match the expected\nstring, and fails the test if it does.  By default, the match must be exact,\nbut line-by-line regular expressions may be used if the TestGyp object was\ninitialized with TestGyp.match_re.\n  test.must_contain(&#39;file&#39;, &#39;substring&#39;)\nVerifies that the specified file contains the specified substring, and fails\nthe test if it does not.\n  test.must_not_contain(&#39;file&#39;, &#39;substring&#39;)\nVerifies that the specified file does not contain the specified substring, and\nfails the test if it does.\n  test.must_contain_all_lines(output, lines)\nVerifies that the output string contains all of the &quot;lines&quot; in the specified\nlist of lines.  In practice, the lines can be any substring and need not be\n\\n-terminaed lines per se.  If any line is missing, the test fails.\n  test.must_not_contain_any_lines(output, lines)\nVerifies that the output string does not contain any of the &quot;lines&quot; in the\nspecified list of lines.  In practice, the lines can be any substring and need\nnot be \\n-terminaed lines per se.  If any line exists in the output string,\nthe test fails.\n  test.must_contain_any_line(output, lines)\nVerifies that the output string contains at least one of the &quot;lines&quot; in the\nspecified list of lines.  In practice, the lines can be any substring and need\nnot be \\n-terminaed lines per se.  If none of the specified lines is present,\nthe test fails.\nReading file contents\n  test.read(&#39;file&#39;)\nReturns the contents of the specified file.  Directory elements contained in a\nlist will be joined:\n  test.read([&#39;subdir&#39;, &#39;file&#39;])\nTest success or failure\n  test.fail_test()\nFails the test, reporting FAILED on standard output and exiting with an exit\nstatus of 1.\n  test.pass_test()\nPasses the test, reporting PASSED on standard output and exiting with an exit\nstatus of 0.\n  test.no_result()\nIndicates the test had no valid result (i.e., the conditions could not be\ntested because of an external factor like a full file system).

Bradley Nelson wrote up the following description of why the team\ncreated GYP instead of using CMake.  The text below is copied from\nhttp://www.mail-archive.com/webkit-dev@lists.webkit.org/msg11029.html\n\nRe: [webkit-dev] CMake as a build system?\nBradley Nelson\nMon, 19 Apr 2010 22:38:30 -0700\n\nHere&#39;s the innards of an email with a laundry list of stuff I came up with a\nwhile back on the gyp-developers list in response to Mike Craddick regarding\nwhat motivated gyp&#39;s development, since we were aware of cmake at the time\n(we&#39;d even started a speculative port):\n\n\nI did an exploratory port of portions of Chromium to cmake (I think I got as\nfar as net, base, sandbox, and part of webkit).\nThere were a number of motivations, not all of which would apply to other\nprojects. Also, some of the design of gyp was informed by experience at\nGoogle with large projects built wholly from source, leading to features\nabsent from cmake, but not strictly required for Chromium.\n\n1. Ability to incrementally transition on Windows. It took us about 6 months\nto switch fully to gyp. Previous attempts to move to scons had taken a long\ntime and failed, due to the requirement to transition while in flight. For a\nsubstantial period of time, we had a hybrid of checked in vcproj and gyp generated\nvcproj. To this day we still have a good number of GUIDs pinned in the gyp files,\nbecause different parts of our release pipeline have leftover assumptions\nregarding manipulating the raw sln/vcprojs. This transition occurred from\nthe bottom up, largely because modules like base were easier to convert, and\nhad a lower churn rate. During early stages of the transition, the majority\nof the team wasn&#39;t even aware they were using gyp, as it integrated into\ntheir existing workflow, and only affected modules that had been converted.\n\n2. Generation of a more &#39;normal&#39; vcproj file. Gyp attempts, particularly on\nWindows, to generate vcprojs which resemble hand generated projects. It\ndoesn&#39;t generate any Makefile type projects, but instead produces msvs\nCustom Build Steps and Custom Build Rules. This makes the resulting projects\neasier to understand from the IDE and avoids parts of the IDE that simply\ndon&#39;t function correctly if you use Makefile projects. Our early hope with\ngyp was to support the least common denominator of features present in each\nof the platform specific project file formats, rather than falling back on\ngenerated Makefiles/shell scripts to emulate some common abstraction. CMake by\ncomparison makes a good faith attempt to use native project features, but\nfalls back on generated scripts in order to preserve the same semantics on\neach platforms.\n\n3. Abstraction on the level of project settings, rather than command line\nflags. In gyp&#39;s syntax you can add nearly any option present in a hand\ngenerated xcode/vcproj file. This allows you to use abstractions built into\nthe IDEs rather than reverse engineering them possibly incorrectly for\nthings like: manifest generation, precompiled headers, bundle generation.\nWhen somebody wants to use a particular menu option from msvs, I&#39;m able to\ndo a web search on the name of the setting from the IDE and provide them\nwith a gyp stanza that does the equivalent. In many cases, not all project\nfile constructs correspond to command line flags.\n\n4. Strong notion of module public/private interface. Gyp allows targets to\npublish a set of direct_dependent_settings, specifying things like\ninclude_dirs, defines, platforms specific settings, etc. This means that\nwhen module A depends on module B, it automatically acquires the right build\nsettings without module A being filled with assumptions/knowledge of exactly\nhow module B is built. Additionally, all of the transitive dependencies of\nmodule B are pulled in. This avoids their being a single top level view of\nthe project, rather each gyp file expresses knowledge about its immediate\nneighbors. This keep local knowledge local. CMake effectively has a large\nshared global namespace.\n\n5. Cross platform generation. CMake is not able to generate all project\nfiles on all platforms. For example xcode projects cannot be generated from\nwindows (cmake uses mac specific libraries to do project generation). This\nmeans that for instance generating a tarball containing pregenerated\nprojects for all platforms is hard with Cmake (requires distribution to\nseveral machine types).\n\n6. Gyp has rudimentary cross compile support. Currently we&#39;ve added enough\nfunctionality to gyp to support x86 -&gt; arm cross compiles. Last I checked\nthis functionality wasn&#39;t present in cmake. (This occurred later).\n\n\nThat being said there are a number of drawbacks currently to gyp:\n\n1. Because platform specific settings are expressed at the project file\nlevel (rather than the command line level). Settings which might otherwise\nbe shared in common between platforms (flags to gcc on mac/linux), end up\nbeing repeated twice. Though in fairness there is actually less sharing here\nthan you&#39;d think. include_dirs and defines actually represent 90% of what\ncan be typically shared.\n\n2. CMake may be more mature, having been applied to a broader range of\nprojects. There a number of &#39;tool modules&#39; for cmake, which are shared in a\ncommon community.\n\n3. gyp currently makes some nasty assumptions about the availability of\nchromium&#39;s hermetic copy of cygwin on windows. This causes you to either\nhave to special case a number of rules, or swallow this copy of cygwin as a\nbuild time dependency.\n\n4. CMake includes a fairly readable imperative language. Currently Gyp has a\nsomewhat poorly specified declarative language (variable expansion happens\nin sometimes weird and counter-intuitive ways). In fairness though, gyp assumes\nthat external python scripts can be used as an escape hatch. Also gyp avoids\na lot of the things you&#39;d need imperative code for, by having a nice target\nsettings publication mechanism.\n\n5. (Feature/drawback depending on personal preference). Gyp&#39;s syntax is\nDEEPLY nested. It suffers from all of Lisp&#39;s advantages and drawbacks.\n\n-BradN\n"}}}
